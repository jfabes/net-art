        Combat, I'm ready for combat<br />
        I say I don't want that, but what if I do?<br />
        'Cause cruelty wins in the movies<br />
        I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you<br />
        Easy they come, easy they go<br />
        I jump from the train, I ride off alone<br />
        I never grew up, it's getting so old<br />
        Help me hold onto you<br />
        I've been the archer<br />
        I've been the prey<br />
        Who could ever leave me, darling?<br />
        But who could stay?<br />
        Dark side, I search for your dark side<br />
        But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?<br />
        And I cut off my nose just to spite my face<br />
        Then I hate my reflection for years and years<br />
        I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost<br />
        The room is on fire, invisible smoke<br />
        And all of my heroes die all alone<br />
        Help me hold onto you<br />
        I've been the archer<br />
        I've been the prey<br />
        Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling?<br />
        But who could stay?<br />
        <em>(I see right through me, I see right through me)</em><br />
        'Cause they see right through me<br />
        They see right through me<br />
        They see right through<br />
        Can you see right through me?<br />
        They see right through<br />
        They see right through me<br />
        I see right through me<br />
        I see right through me<br />
        All the king's horses, all the king's men<br />
        Couldn't put me together again<br />
        'Cause all of my enemies started out friends<br />
        Help me hold onto you<br />
        I've been the archer<br />
        I've been the prey<br />
        Who could ever leave me, darling?<br />
        But who could stay?<br />
        <em>(I see right through me, I see right through me)</em><br />
        Who could stay?<br />
        Who could stay?<br />
        Who could stay?<br />
        You could stay<br />
        You could stay<br />
        You<br />
        Combat, I'm ready for combat<br />
