        The act of storytelling transcends age, sex, and time, connecting all
        who partake. Great storytelling utilizes humanity's urge to connect to
        its advantage. The phrase, "A picture is worth million words", has taken
        recent society by storm. The expansion of technology leaves many stories
        to be told on an expansive scale. Now, more than ever, we have the
        opportunity to document and tell even the most mundane stories. From the
        humanization of dehumanized cam girls on the internet over an 18-month
        journey, to the moments captured on Google Images telling a higher level
        story of humanity, to the exploration of digital narrative
        possibilities. The internet has opened a new can of worms that has
        raised questions about humanity's morals and its ability to connect
        through the electricity that binds us all.
